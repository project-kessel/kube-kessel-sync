This project uses nested Go tests. To run a specific test, the argument to -run should follow this pattern:

`{parent test pattern}/"{sub test pattern}"`

If there is multiple levels of nesting, then you add another `/` delimeter followed by another pattern, like so:

`{parent test pattern}/"{sub test pattern}"/"{sub test pattern}"`

Example command for this project:

`go test ./internal/mapper -run TestMapper/resource/"role update"`
